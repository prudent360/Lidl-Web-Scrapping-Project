      "Review Text: Was in the Musselburgh (EH21 6QD) and The manager (David) was very rude with me. I noticed only one kettle on the shelf that i wanted however the box had been opened before and keytle was not in the box. It looked as if it was thrown back in and inner bag was not on the kettle, but at bottom of the box. It was clearly a returned item back on shelf for resale. So.as I.spoke with David I asked him for another at back or a discount on this as I told him I will not pay new for the condition it was in. His response. I quote \"THEN YOU WONT BE BUYING THIS AS I AM NOT DISCOUNTING IT\"  So I called head office to complain. I was let down as a customer and.spoke to like i was made to feel like worthless as a customer. Outraged, upset and angry at it all. Complaint reference number is 113535621\n",

Latest example is their cheap toilet paper... price has gone up and quality has gone down (two ply? Nope.). Also, the Use-by/BBE management in my local shop is completely broken, I've bought a few packs of ham, a salami and some Stilton way beyond the printed dates (meaning more than two weeks!).

It happens all the time, price goes up 20% and more each year.Smaller packs, without notice, fruits and gegies rotting one day after purchase, frozen thru or thrown from place to place.And this minced meat in ugly blocks.Lidl is so smart, so time to be smarter. No more promo coupons and no money spent in Lidl.Finally I understand Lidl strategy, they really don't want solid customer, they began to play like broadband sellers.\n",

      "Review Text: I was extremely concerned about my experience in Lidl today in Green Street. Previously I have had a good experience there however today none of the middle of Lidl prices were on display and yet they seem to have products there other products were mislabelled with last weeks prices and products. There were several things that I would’ve liked to have bought, but I had no idea how much they were. The self service tills were not all open probably half open. People were queueing for lengthy periods. I was shocked that they could function like this. I don’t know what’s happening but I’ve never experienced this in the East Ham branch or the Stratford branch. I would suggest a senior manager visit the store urgently as it is in severe risk of not following trading standards.\n",

No cartons of milk left on the shelves, price per KG labels missing off half the fresh produce so you can't compare prices. Floors filthy. Queuing to pay with just one till open. This has been going on for months now, and to cap it off when you put your card in the machine to pay it now asks you to make a charity donation before paying. Last straw, wave goodbye to my money.\n",

Not only is the packaging to contents volume deceiving, it is also wasteful and bad for the environment. I’m surprised at Lidl for allowing their trucks to ship so much fresh air, let alone have it take up space in their chillers. 3 boxes carry enough space to fit another full rack of ribs! I wish I could post the picture here, it really is laughable.\n",

      "Review Text: review  delayed because did not know what to do but it's had an effect on my health in general since last year I confined in a friend who is a councillor from London who lives now in Manchester and it's part of my support network and the informed him of an incident that took place in my local store that when I did my shopping I left  the store had no problems staff supportive left to store and went to the Tesco's next door but I ran out of bags so I thought I go back into the store lidi to get some extra bags because the woman who was in the shop at the time she helped me to use selfcheck out because I wasn't very confident using them upon going back in the store I had a ucksack on I'm clearly   on CCTV and if staff look hard enough I'm sure they'll know exactly what security guardi am referring tsays he's an Asian male sibert 6 foot tall around my height he stopped me as approached going into store for the second time in mind I just left it to go to other stored at Tesco's next door to get some extra shopping from Tesco upon entering the store again security guard stops me unknownst and says to me straight aggressively what's in your bag as tell them clearly nothing and I stay very clearly why I'm bringing into the store he starts getting abusive threatening he even goes as far as saying citizens arrest Holly would call the police if I didn't open my bag he got that aggressive I got scared and as I took my bag off he grabbed it he had no right to do so and he was that intimidating I thought he was doing something by him one of his store members staff saw what was going on and she was frightened herself to the point where she just said just stand aside and I'll get you some carrier bags upon trying to get out the store he continued to be verbally abusive he even went as far as using language that was unappropriate in front of public members and then starting on a homeless woman outside the store making threats towards her and when I spoke to this homeless woman apparently he's known to abuse members of the public and the homeless community outside store in general I stated to this man very clearly that I am si registered myself he then sold me but for the comments to the point he said what are you going to do about it I've not been well since it instant took place as of one other medication for my own health conditions the security guard did not have the right to stop me as there was no suspicion of any shoplifting bear in mind out just spent a lot of money in store he did not see me enter the store the first time and he did not see me leave the store the first time the cameras don't lie I have felt that badly affected that when I told my friend because he wanted to go into that store this month February 2025 I told him what happened and I will never shop with the company again or even in that store when I told the security guard this I will not shot in the store again after he treated me he said he does not care I am a nobody and use fill language I was actually not when I left and totally in shock last year around November December 2024 I'm sure they can track the dates with their CCTV I don't know the security guard's name but I certainly would be able to identify him again he's the most aggressive security guard in Manchester should not be in the industry my friend even said that I should report them to the police and local SIA authority when I actually told this guy last year security report into the siu he said that I was nothing in the nobody go for it there's nothing I can do so I'm putting this review on simpler to tell people stay away from that store because you're safety is at risk until they get rid of that security guard I would not advise getting in there that's security guard gets away with it and thinks you can get away with it and probably will continue to get away with his behavior two members of the public and to the homeless community is disgraceful speak to the homeless community outside the store the regular homeless people that do hang around the store but because no problems more friendly than what the security guards let's just put it that way one female in particular she's about five foot in height they've used it she got that night as well I felt sorry for and anyone else has to go through this well this company take action probably not as this happened before to someone else highly lately has anyone step forward probably not for the public safety should be first i call on this store to sack the security guard for the sake of the company and for the safety of the public he made a very clear that night he can get away with what he wants to do and he probably will in the future if this review is not taken on board and nothing gets done  you only have to speak to people outside the store the homeless woman outside regularly she will soon confirm the behavior that this man is doing towards customers in and out of store next steps for me if legal action\n",

My purchases were made in December and the expiry date on the tins are September 2027, but unfortunately I was unable to open using the ‘key’ on the tin, it broke off on 2 tins and despite the faulty key opening this policy stands.Lidl Customer Care Team have responded to clarify it is in fact 30 days from date of sale. I feel they failed to realize my experience has damaged their brand reputation all for the sake of less than a fiver but it was not a financial issue, it was a managerial one. Their response to my complaint was prompt and apologetic, and I do appreciate and thank them for that.\n",

I was in the fridge section trying to make a selection of prawns when she came and rudely closed the fridge which I had opened just so she could put the carton of cod and stack the overhead fridge.Today is 4th of feb. 2025, I would normally react when mistreated but this just baffled me and threw me off guard as I was in deep shock. I have been shopping here for over 3 years now and come to this supermarket not less than 2times a week. I won’t say they are the friendliest but this was outright the worst customer service I have ever experienced, need I say that when the lady was done, she didn’t deem it fit to open back the fridge or apologize as I was just beside her in awe. It was more like she had a score to settle with me.Lidl barkerend road, you guys need to work on your customer service, I am only given 1 star because I can’t give zero.\n",
